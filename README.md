This is the java code for a visual version of the TopographicalMap Logger/Generator.

However due to time constraints, this code is for a statically generated terrain, it can easily be modified to use a noise function for the height, as well as be modified to take input data and display it in 3d form.

I possibly might work on this code this summer or next semester, depending on my schedule.  I do plan on improving this project as I dislike not having completed it due to the time restraints of the semester.
